# Complex_HumanActivityRecognition

- there are 1169999 data points in the dataset
- 10 healthy participants aged 25-35
-<font color='blue'> Seven activities were performed by all ten participants </font> which are <font color='red'>walking, jogging, biking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting and standing</font>. 
- These activities were performed for <font color='red'>3 min</font> by each participant
-  <font color='blue'>Seven out of these ten participants</font> performed <font color='red'> eating, typing, writing, drinking coffee and giving a talk. </font>
- These activities were performed for <font color='red'>5–6 min. </font> Smoking was performed by six out of these ten participants, where each of them smoked one cigarette. Only six participants were smokers among the ten participants.
- We used 30 min of data for each activity with an equal amount of data from each participant. This
resulted in a dataset of 390 (13 × 30) min.
- so according to the above data, i divided 1169999 datapoints by 390 minutes which gives 0.02 seconds. so this is the calculated time which we have used in featurization.
- i performed eda, then featurization and the modelling as shown in the ipynb.
